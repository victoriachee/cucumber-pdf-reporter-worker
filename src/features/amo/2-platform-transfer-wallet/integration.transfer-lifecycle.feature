Feature: Integration Flow - Transfer wallet lifecycle
  As APISYS
  I want to call transfer APIs in sequence
  So that I can verify wallet balance changes and transfer reversal end to end

  Background:
    Given a merchant member exists

  Scenario: Transfer in, transfer out, cancel transfer, and idempotent cancel

    # transfer in
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When APISYS requests transfer in with:
      | field             | value                |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no_1>      |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>  |
      | currency          | <currency>           |
      | amount            | 100                  |
    Then the AMO010 response should be successful
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should increase by 100

    # transfer out
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When APISYS requests transfer out with:
      | field             | value                 |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no_2>       |
      | game_type         | <game_type>           |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>   |
      | currency          | <currency>            |
      | amount            | -35                   |
      | session_id        | <session_id>          |
    Then the AMO011 response should be successful
    And I store the response field "reference_id" as "amo011_reference_id"
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should decrease by 35

    # cancel transfer
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When APISYS requests cancel transfer with:
      | field       | value           |
      | transfer_no | <transfer_no_2> |
    Then the AMO014 response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field        | value               |
      | reference_id | any non-empty value |
    And I store the response field "reference_id" as "cancel_reference_id"
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should increase by 35

    # idempotent cancel
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When APISYS requests cancel transfer with:
      | field       | value           |
      | transfer_no | <transfer_no_2> |
    Then the AMO014 response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field        | value                  |
      | reference_id | <cancel_reference_id>  |
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should remain unchanged

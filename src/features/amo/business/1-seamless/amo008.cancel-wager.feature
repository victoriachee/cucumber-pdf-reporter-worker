Feature: AMO008 Cancel Wager
  As APISYS
  I want to call the merchant cancel wager API
  So that the merchant can cancel a wager and refund the member when necessary

  Background:
    Given a merchant member exists

  @success @idempotency
  Scenario: Refund on cancel then return same result for duplicate cancel
    Given the member has positive wallet balance in "<currency>"
    And I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    And I prepare a deduction amount of 10

    When I call AMO003 "Request Payment" API with:
      | field             | value               |
      | transaction_no    | <transaction_no_1>  |
      | game_key          | <game_key_seamless> |
      | parent_wager_no   | <parent_wager_no>   |
      | platform_username | <platform_username> |
      | currency          | <currency>          |
      | amount            | -<deduction_amount> |
      | orders            | [{ "wager_no": "<wager_no>", "ticket_no": "<ticket_no_1>", "type": <wager_type.normal_wager>, "amount": <deduction_amount>, "payment_amount": <deduction_amount>, "effective_amount": <deduction_amount>, "metadata": <metadata>, "metadata_type": <metadata_type>, "wager_time": <wager_time>, "is_system_reward": <is_system_reward> }] |
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value               |
      | reference_id      | any non-empty value |
      | status            | 1                   |
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should decrease by "<deduction_amount>"

    # cancel wager to refund payment
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I call AMO008 "Cancel Wager" API with:
      | field             | value                 |
      | transaction_no    | <transaction_no_2>    |
      | game_key          | <game_key_seamless>   |
      | wager_no          | <wager_no>            |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>   |
      | metadata          | <metadata>            |
      | metadata_type     | <metadata_type>       |
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value                 |
      | reference_id      | any non-empty value   |
    And I store the response field "reference_id" as "amo008_reference_id"
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should increase by "<deduction_amount>"

    # cancel wager again to verify idempotency
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I call AMO008 "Duplicate Cancel Wager" API with:
      | field             | value                 |
      | transaction_no    | <transaction_no_2>    |
      | game_key          | <game_key_seamless>   |
      | wager_no          | <wager_no>            |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>   |
      | metadata          | <metadata>            |
      | metadata_type     | <metadata_type>       |
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value                 |
      | reference_id      | <amo008_reference_id> |
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should remain unchanged

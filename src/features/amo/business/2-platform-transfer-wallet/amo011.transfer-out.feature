Feature: AMO011 Request Transfer Out
  As APISYS
  I want to call the merchant transfer out API
  So that I can debit funds from the member wallet

  Scenario: Transfer out decreases wallet balance
    Given the member has positive wallet balance in "<currency>"
    And I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I call AMO011 API with:
      | field             | value                       |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no>               |
      | game_type         | <game_type_transfer_wallet> |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>         |
      | currency          | <currency>                  |
      | amount            | -20.5                       |
      | session_id        | <session_id>                |
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value                       |
      | reference_id      | any non-empty value         |
      | amount            | -20.5                       |
      | status            | 1                           |
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should decrease by 20.5

  Scenario: Idempotent transfer
    Wallet updates once per transfer_no
    Validate same reference_id is returned in both attempts
    
    Given the member has positive wallet balance in "<currency>"
    And I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I prepare a request payload with:
      | field             | value                       |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no>               |
      | game_type         | <game_type_transfer_wallet> |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>         |
      | currency          | <currency>                  |
      | amount            | 100                         |
      | session_id        | <session_id>                |
    And I call AMO010 "Request Transfer In - First request" API
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value                       |
      | reference_id      | any non-empty value         |
      | status            | 1                           |
    And I store the full response as "first_response"
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should increase by 100

    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I call AMO010 "Request Transfer In - Duplicate transfer_no" API
    Then the response should be the same as stored response "first_response"
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should remain unchanged
    

  Scenario: Insufficient balance returns failed status
    Given I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    And I prepare an amount exceeding the balance by 10
    When I call AMO011 API with:
      | field             | value                       |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no>               |
      | game_type         | <game_type_transfer_wallet> |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>         |
      | currency          | <currency>                  |
      | amount            | -<amount_exceeding_balance> |
      | session_id        | <session_id>                |
    Then the response should be successful
    And the response should contain:
      | field             | value                       |
      | reference_id      | any non-empty value         |
      | status            | 2                           |
    And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should remain unchanged

Scenario: Not providing amount transfers out all integer wallet balance
  Given the member has positive wallet balance in "<currency>"
  And I record the current wallet balance in "<currency>"
    When I call AMO011 API with:
    | field               | value                       |
    | transfer_no         | <transfer_no>               |
    | game_type           | <game_type_transfer_wallet> |
    | platform_username   | <platform_username>         |
    | currency            | <currency>                  |
    | session_id          | <session_id>                |
  Then the response should be successful
  And the response should contain:
    | field               | value                       |
    | reference_id        | any non-empty value         |
    | status              | 1                           |
  And the response amount should equal the integer part of the recorded wallet balance in "<currency>"
  And the wallet balance in "<currency>" should equal the remaining decimal balance

  Scenario: Validation fails when amount precision is invalid
    When I call AMO011 API with:
      | field             | value                       |
      | transfer_no       | <transfer_no>               |
      | game_type         | <game_type_transfer_wallet> |
      | platform_username | <platform_username>         |
      | currency          | <currency>                  |
      | amount            | -1.1234567                  |
      | session_id        | <session_id>                |
    Then the response should fail validation

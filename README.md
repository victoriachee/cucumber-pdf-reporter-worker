# API Test Platform

Async API scenario testing platform for **merchant wallet integration**.

---

# 1. Architecture & Tech Stack

## Stack

- Express: API layer  
- BullMQ + Redis: async job processing  
- Cucumber: scenario execution  
- HTML Reporter: report generation  
- Puppeteer: PDF export  

---

## Core Architecture

```mermaid

    Client --> API["API Server"]
    API --> Queue["BullMQ Queue"]
    Queue --> Redis["Redis"]
    Redis --> Worker["Worker"]
    Worker --> Cucumber["Cucumber Runner"]
    Cucumber --> Merchant
    Worker --> Report["HTML + PDF"]
```

## Async Execution Model

Test runs are executed using **Job → Queue → Worker**.

### Job
- created via `POST /tests/run`
- represents one test run
- tracked by `jobId`

### Queue (BullMQ + Redis)
- stores jobs
- schedules execution
- controls concurrency
- supports retry and cancellation

### Worker
- processes jobs
- selects scenarios
- runs Cucumber
- calls APIs via configured endpoints
- captures request/response
- generates reports

### Why

- non-blocking API
- parallel execution
- persistent jobs (Redis)
- controllable runs (cancel/retry)

---

# 2. Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Queue
    participant Worker
    participant Cucumber
    participant APISYS
    participant Merchant
    participant Report

    Client->>API: POST /tests/run
    API->>Queue: enqueue job
    Queue->>Worker: process job

    Worker->>Cucumber: execute scenarios
    Cucumber->>APISYS: trigger flow
    APISYS->>Merchant: API request
    Merchant-->>APISYS: response
    APISYS-->>Cucumber: result

    Worker->>Report: generate HTML/PDF
    API-->>Client: status / report endpoints
    Client->>API: GET /tests/reports
```

### Output

```
reports/runs/<timestamp>/
  index.html
  report.pdf
```

Each run includes:

- request + response payloads  
- error payloads  
- structured error context  

---

# 3. Validation & Scenario Model

## What is Validated

> APISYS → Merchant requests  
> Merchant → APISYS responses  

Checks:

- request structure and payload  
- response format and values  
- error handling  

---

## How Scenarios Are Determined

Two inputs control execution:

### 1. Game Wallet Mode (what scenarios to test)

- Seamless → wallet operation APIs (request-payment, settle, etc.)  
- Transfer Wallet → transfer APIs (transfer-in/out, cancel-transfer)  

---

### 2. Merchant Wallet Mode 

Defines the actual API endpoints to be called:

- Seamless → points to merchant APIs  
- Transfer Wallet → points to APISYS APIs  

---

## Resolution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Merchant's Owned Games"] --> B["Game Mode"]
    C["Merchant's merchant_settings"] --> D["API Endpoints"]

    B --> E["Select Scenarios"]

    E --> G["Execute Scenarios"]
    D --> G
```

### Rules

- **Game mode determines scenarios**
- **Merchant mode (merchant_settings) determines API endpoints**
